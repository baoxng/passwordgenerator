# passwordgenerator

## Project description
For this project, it was very, very, very challenging. I had to generate password with some certain requirments. The requirements were being within 8-128 characters long and generating a random string of characters, numbers, lower case and upper case alphabet. If user includes all or some of the random strings they should get a random password with the desired length.
