# passwordgenerator

## Project description
For this project, it was very, very, very challenging. I had to generate password with some certain requirments. The requirements were being within 8-128 characters long and generating a random string of characters, numbers, lower case and upper case alphabet. If user includes all or some of the random strings they should get a random password with the desired length.

## Development
I had lots of difficulties with building the codes that I used. I was looking and researching various hours of the day to make sure the codes were working. This task was harder for me to excute. I had lots of mistakes and I was working really hard and really long hours. I think if I took the time to make this better and excute what I wanted it would be a good lesson in javascript. I had to hard reset my codes because some methods weren't working for me. Overall I did learn a lot of other useful information for coding javascript. I will be implementing my struggles and research this time to future projects.
